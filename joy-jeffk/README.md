## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is a blog where a user can enter new articles into blogArticles.js and the articles are added to index.html.  We had to do the following tasks:
- Pick one CSS styling from what each partner wrote yesterday, or merge them together.
- Complete the .toHtml() method, ensuring the blogs are in date order showing newest first.
- Complete the Article constructor function.
- Use proper jQuery to complete all tasks, including DOM manipulation and transversal.
- Refactor for loops as .forEach() methods.
